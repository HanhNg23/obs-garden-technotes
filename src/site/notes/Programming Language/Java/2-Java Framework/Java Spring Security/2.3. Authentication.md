# 2.3 Authentication
   <span style="color:#d4a216">2 Parts</span>
- The Servlet Authentication Architecture - concentrate on abstract describing the architecture without much discussion on how it applies to concrete flows
- The Authentication Mechanisms - concentrate on concrete ways in which users can authenticate
## 2.3.1 Part 1 - Discuss Servlet Authentication Architecture
   - This is the expands on Architecture Section Above - ¬†[Servlet Security: The Big Picture](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/architecture.html#servlet-architecture), describe the main architectural components of SprSe's used in Servlet Authentication, include following here :
	   -  <span style="color:#555555">SecurityContextHolder</span>
	   -  <span style="color:#555555">SecurityContextHolder</span>
	   -  <span style="color:#555555">Authentication (Obj)</span>
	   -  <span style="color:#555555">GrantedAuthority</span>
	   -  <span style="color:#555555">AuthenticationManager</span>

### 2.3.2.1 SecurityContextHolder
- `SecurityContextHolder` - the heart of Spring Security's authentication model 
- <span style="color:#d4a216">It contains the `SecurityContext`</span>
- This is the place that SprSe stores the details of who is authenticated
- But do not care if `SecurityContextHolder` is populated
- *If contains a value --> it is used as the currently authenticated user*
- <span style="color:#81ed0c">For example, setting directly the indicated authenticated user in `SecurityContextHolder`</span>
	```Java
	SecurityContext context = SecurityContextHolder.createEmptyContext(); 1
	Authentication authentication =
	    new TestingAuthenticationToken("username", "password", "ROLE_USER"); 2
	context.setAuthentication(authentication);
	
	SecurityContextHolder.setContext(context); 3
	```
	1. <span style="color:#d4a216">Create empty `SecurityContext`</span> (Should create a new `SecurityContext` instance instead of using *SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication)* --> avoid race conditions accross multiple threads)
	2. <span style="color:#d4a216">Create a new Authentication object</span> - SprSe <span style="color:#0070c0">does note care what type of Authentication</span> implementation is set on the `SecurityContext` - in our example, we use Authentication the type is `TestingAuthenticationToken` (the other popular type is UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, password, authorities)
	3. <span style="color:#d4a216">Set the `SecurityContext` object on `SecurityContextHolder`</span> --> <span style="color:#3adf97">SprSe will use this information for Authorization</span>
- <span style="color:#d4a216">How to access `Currently Authenticated User`</span>
	```Java
		SecurityContext context = SecurityContextHolder.getContext();
		Authentication authentication = context.getAuthentication();
		String username = authentication.getName();
		Object principal = authentication.getPrincipal();
		Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> authorities = authentication.getAuthorities();	
	```
- > [!NOTE] Clear the current `SecurityContext` instance after request processed
  > Imagine that you do not want save the current authenticated user in the `SecuritContext` obj after the process of request done for saving memory
  > -> Note that, `SecurityContextHolder` uses a `ThreadLocal` to store these details --> So the `SecurityContext` is always available to methods in the same thread (even if the `SecuirtyContext` is not explicitly passed around as an argument to those method - t·ª©c d√π ko c√≥ method n√†o nh·∫≠n SecurityContext l√†m tham s·ªë truy·ªÅn v√†o th√¨ t·∫°i thread hi·ªán t·∫°i ƒëang d√πng v·∫ßn c√≤n l∆∞u `SecurityContext`)
  > --> Using a `ThreadLocal` in this way is quite safe if you take care to clear the thread after the present principal's request is processed. But with <span style="color:#81ed0c">SprSe's `FilterChainProxy` ensures that the `SecurityContext` is always cleared</span>.
- > [!CAUTION]
  >  There is an issue is here that some applications are not entirely suitable for using a `ThreadLocal` - because of the specific way they work with threads -- for ex, Swing client might want all threads in a JVM to use the same security context.
  > <span style="color:#d4a216">Resolve --> You can configure `SecurityContextHolder` with a strategy on startup to specify how you would like the context to be stored</span>.
  > For example, config: 
  > 	- `SecurityContextHolder.MODE_GLOBAL`¬†strategy
  >     - `SecurityContextHolder.MODE_INHERITABLETHREADLOCAL`
  > üçé Take a look at the JavaDoc for¬†[`SecurityContextHolder`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/core/context/SecurityContextHolder.html) to learn more.> 	
- > [!INFO] ThreadLocal
  > It is a mechanism to manage the multi thread and each its value
  > For example, if you want to store the value for the current thread is in used -> tell the thread local to "map the current thread with my value please !"--> The power of the Thread local is that avoid the current thread retrieving value from another thread, it just allows the current thread can set and get the values its own.

### 2.3.2.2 SecurityContext
- Obtained from the `SecurityContextHolder`
- Contains an `Authentication` object
### 2.3.2.3 Authentication
- It is an interface - serves 2 main purposes within SprSe:
	- <span style="color:#d4a216">An input to `AuthenticationManager`</span> to provide the credentials which the user has provided to authenticate
	- <span style="color:#d4a216">Represent the currently authenticated user</span> --> So you can obtain the current Authentication from the `SecurityContext`
- > [!Info] Authentication contains :
  > - Principal: Identifies the user - *<span style="color:#d4a216">when authenticating with a username/password - this is often an instance of `UserDetails`</span>*
   > - Credentials: Often a password - In many cases, this is cleared after the user is authenticated to avoid memory leak 
   > - Authorities: The `GrantedAuthority` instances - high-level permissions the user is granted. 2 examples are ROLES and SCOPES
- > [!Info] ¬†Implementing Classes derived from Authentication Interface

### 2.3.2.4 GrantedAuthority
- C√≥ th·ªÉ hi·ªÉu l√† label g√°n nh√£n quy·ªÅn h·∫°n c·ªßa ng∆∞·ªùi ƒëƒÉng nh·∫≠p ƒë·ªëi v·ªõi app
- Obtain `GrantedAuthority` instances from the `Authentication.getAuthorities()`¬†method - this method provides a Collection of `GrantedAuthority` objects.
	```Java
		SecurityContext context = SecurityContextHolder.getContext();
		Authentication authentication = context.getAuthentication();
		String username = authentication.getName();
		Object principal = authentication.getPrincipal();
		Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> authorities = authentication.getAuthorities();	
	```
- -> A GrantedAuthority is an authority that is granted to the principal. Such authorities are usually "roles" (ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_HR_SUPERVISOR) -> <span style="color:#81ed0c">these roles are later configured for **web authorization**, **method authorization**, **domain object authorization**</span>
- <span style="color:#81ed0c">For example, method authorization, there is a method that only allow access for some kind of roles</span> 
```Java
@Secured("ROLE_VIEWER") public String getUsername() { SecurityContext securityContext = SecurityContextHolder.getContext(); return securityContext.getAuthentication().getName(); }

@Secured({ "ROLE_VIEWER", "ROLE_EDITOR" }) public boolean isValidUsername(String username) { return userRoleRepository.isValidUsername(username); }

-----

@RolesAllowed("ROLE_VIEWER") public String getUsername2() { //... } 

@RolesAllowed({ "ROLE_VIEWER", "ROLE_EDITOR" }) public boolean isValidUsername2(String username) { //... }
```
- üçé Learn more: [Introduction to Spring Method Security](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-method-security)
- When using username/password based authentication then ¬†`GrantedAuthority`¬†instances are usually loaded by the¬†[`UserDetailsService`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authentication/passwords/user-details-service.html#servlet-authentication-userdetailsservice)
- <span style="color:#81ed0c">Usually, the GrantedAuthority Objects are application-wide permissions - they are not specific to a given domain object</span>
### 2.3.2.5 AuthenticationManager
- Is the API - defines how SprSe's Filters perform authentication process to build `Authentication` obj - this means that the  `AuthenticationManager` help to specify which Authentication Mechanism is used for authentication
  - > [!NOTE]
   > Because there are various Authentication mechanisms or can call as Authentication Provider for implementation to authenticate the obj `Authentication`, for ex: 
   > ![](https://i.imgur.com/0K05mXr.png)
   > *<span style="font-style:italic; color:#d4a216">You can also create your own custom Authentication Provider</span>*
   > <span style="color:#7030a0">->  So these type will be manage by `AuthenticationManager` ---> we can tell `AuthenticationManager` which Authentication type you want to implement for authentication üòé </span>
   > 
   > üçé Reference : [Spring Security ‚Äì Authentication Providers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/spring-security-authentication-providers/) 
   >
{ #Authentication-Providers}

- The `Authentication` obj that is returned after the process of authentication done (do not care the user valid or invalid) is then set on the [SecurityContextHolder](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authentication/architecture.html#servlet-authentication-securitycontextholder) by the controller that invoked the `AuthenticationManager`
- <span style="color:#d4a216">Because the `AuthenticationManager` is an interface -> the implementation of it could be anything. The most common implementation is `ProviderManager`</span>
### 2.3.2.6 ProviderManager
- `ProviderManager` - the most commonly used <span style="color:#d4a216">implementation of</span> `AuthenticationManager`
- <span style="color:#d4a216">`ProviderManager` delegates to a List of `AuthenticationProvider` instances</span>
- ![](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/_images/servlet/authentication/architecture/providermanager.png)
- > [!Info] About `AuthenticationProvider`
   > - Each `AuthenticationProvider` has an <span style="color:#d4a216">opportunity to indicate</span> that authentication should be successfull || fail || indicate it cannot make a decision -> then allow a downstream ¬†`AuthenticationProvider`¬†to decide
	> - If none of the configured `AuthenticationProvider` instances can authenticate -> <span style="color:#d4a216">authentication fails with exception</span> `ProviderNotFoundException` (mean - `AuthenticationException` indicates the `ProviderManager` was not configured to support the [[Programming Language/Java/2-Java Framework/Java Spring Security/2.3. Authentication#^Authentication-Implementing-Classes\|type of Authentication]] that was passed into it)
	> - Each `AuthenticationProvider` knows how to perform a specific type of authentication
    > For ex, one `AuthenticationProvider` might be able use to validate a username/password (like `DaoAuthenticationProvider`) but another might be able to authenticate a SAML assertion (like )
- `ProviderManager` also allows configuring an optional parent `AuthenticationManager`
	- The parent can be any type of `AuthenticationManager`, but it is often an instance of `ProviderManager`
	 ![](https://i.imgur.com/E4vaBOj.png)
	-  Multiple `ProviderManager` instances might share the same parent `AuthenticationManager` - this is somewhat common in scenarios where there are <span style="color:#d4a216">multiple `SecurityFilterChain` instances have some authentication in common</span> but can also <span style="color:#d4a216">different authetication mechanisms</span> (the different ProviderManager instances)
- Default, <span style="color:#81ed0c">`ProviderManager` tries to clear any sensitive credentials information from the Authentication obj which is returned by a successful authentication request</span> -> avoid being retained longer than necessary in the `HttpSession` --> But can cause issues when use a cache of user objects (for ex to improve performance in a stateless application)
### 2.3.2.7 AuthenticationProvider
- Can inject mutiples `AuthenticationProviders` instances into ProviderManager
- Each `AuthenticationProviders` performs a specific type of authentication
- Ex: 
	- DaoAuthenticationProvider supports username/password-based authentication
	- `JwtAuthenticationProvider`¬†supports authenticating a JWT token
- Another existing AuthenticationProviders which Spre Support [[Programming Language/Java/2-Java Framework/Java Spring Security/2.3. Authentication#^Authentication-Providers\|#^Authentication-Providers]]
### 2.3.2.8 Request Credentials with AuthenticationEntryPoint
- This is used to send an HTTP response that requests credentials from a client
- If the request is to a resource -> SprSe does not need to provide HTTP response that requests credentials from the client (since they are already included)
- <span style="color:#d4a216">Another case to show the useful of Request Credentials with¬†`AuthenticationEntryPoint` is that when a client makes an unauthenticated request to a resource -> the are not authorized to access -> an implementation of `AuthenticationEntryPoint` is used to request back the credentials from the client by how -> it might perform a redirect to a login page and respond with an [WWW-Authenticate](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authentication/passwords/basic.html#servlet-authentication-basic)¬†header, or take other action</span>.
### 2.3.2.9 AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter
- It is used as a base Filter for authenticating a user's credentials
- Before the credentials can be authenticated --> SprSe typically requests the CREDENTIALS by using `AuthenticationEntryPoint` (in the case request to the resource but not login)
- If the credentials of client exists -> the `AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter` can authenticate any authentication requests that are submitted to it
