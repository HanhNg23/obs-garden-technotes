# 2.4 Authorization
<span style="color:#91819c">This section concentrates to configure your application's authorization rules</span>
- Consider attaching authorization rules to request URIs and methods
- Consider how Spring Security authorization works
- Describes the SprSe architecture that applies to authorization
- Authorities
	- Authentication has referred that all the implementations of Authentication Interface <span style="color:#d4a216"> store a list of `GrantedAuthority` objects</span> - represent the authorities (quy·ªÅn h·∫°n) that have been granted to the principal

 2.4.1 The `GrantedAuthority` objects -> <span style="color:#d4a216">inserted into the Authentication obj by the `AuthenticationManager`</span> & are later <span tyle="color:#d4a216">read by `AccessDecisionManager` instances when making authorization decisions</span>

  > [!Note] Method `String getAuthority();`
  > This method is used by an `AuthorizationManager` instance to obtain a precise **String** **representation of the `GrantedAuthority`**-> this String - a `GrantedAuthority` (th·∫±ng ƒë·∫°i di·ªán cho th·∫±ng n√†y l√† c√°i string ƒë∆∞·ª£c tr·∫£ v·ªÅ t·ª´ `String getAuthority();`) can be "read" easily by most `AuthorizationManager` implementations
	  
  > [!Caution] String is null
  > - If a `GrantedAuthority` cannot be precisely represented as a String - be considered "complex" -> `getAuthority()`will be must return null.
  > - The "complex" of `GrantedAuthority` would be an implementation that stores a List of operations and authority thresholds(for example, instead contains one Role, the implementation stores a list different roles) --> representing this complex GrantedAuthority as a String (this refer have to read the array) would be DIFFICULT --> As a result, the getAuthority() method should return null.
  > ==> any AuthorizationManager want to support the specific GrantedAuthority (for ex: for role USER || ADMIN retrieve from the list which contain both USER, ADMIN) -> need to support the specific `GrantedAuthority` implementation (for example: implementing classes `OAuth2UserAuthority`, `OcidcUserAuthority`,..) to understand its "complex" contents
	- <span style="color:#d4a216">RESOVE HOW ?</span>
	   - SprSe includes one concrete `GrantedAuthority`¬†implementation:¬†`SimpleGrantedAuthority` --> this implementation lets any user-specified `String`¬†be converted into a¬†`GrantedAuthority` (s·∫Ω ki·ªÉu ƒë·ªçc t·ª´ danh s√°ch c√°c role, l·∫•y ra m·ªôt role v√† convert sang Sring). All `AuthenticationProvider`¬†instances included with the security architecture use¬†`SimpleGrantedAuthority`¬†to populate the¬†`Authentication`¬†object.

- 2.4.2 The Invocation Handling - Handle the spring security exceptions
	- <span style="color:#9a7db0">**SprSe provides interceptors** (s·ª± chen gi·ªØa/chen ngang) --> that control access to secure (such as method invocations or web request)</span>
	- <span style="color:#9a7db0">**A pre-invocation** decision on whether the invocation is allowed to proceed - this is made by `AuthorizationManager` instances</span>
	- <span style="color:#9a7db0">**A post-invocation** decisions on whether a given value may be returned - this is made by `AuthorizationManager` instances</span>
     <span style="color:#9a7db0">So, what is `AuthorizationManager` and how it make access control decision</span>
	---
	- <span style="color:#00b050">The `AuthorizationManger` - what is ?</span>
		- `AuthorizationManager` supersedes both `AccessDecisionManger` and `AccessDecisionVoter` - [link](#^AccessDecisionManager-and-AccessDecisionVoter)
		- > [!Caution]
	      > Applications that customize an `AccessDecsionManager` or `AccessDecisionVoter` need to change to use `AuthorizationManager` (because from Spr 6.0.0 the `AccessDecisionManager` has been deprecated) 
		- `AuthorizationManager`s **are called by SprSe's** 
			- <span style="color:#ff0000">request based authorization - Authorize `HttpServletRequests`</span>
			- <span style="color:#ff0000">method-based authorization - Method Security</span> 
			- <span style="color:#ff0000"> message-based authorization - WebSocket Security</span>
		- `AuthorizationManager` are responsible for making final access control decisions. 
		- The interface contains two methods
			![](https://i.imgur.com/uRDrasQ.png)
		- `check` method is passed all the relevant information it needs in order to make an authorization decision - information: authentication, secured object
			- the `check` method in implementations (c√°c class tri·ªÉn khai `AuthorizationDecision`) expected return 
				- POSITIVE `AuthorizationDecision` access is GRANTED
				- NEGATIVE `AuthorizationDecision` access is DENIED
				- NULL `AuthorizationDecision` decision is ABSTAIN
				  <span style="color:#555555">(compare to `AccessDecisionVoter` which the implementations vote method return 3 kind of static field name: ACCESS_ABSTAIN, ACCESS_GRANTED, ACCESS_DENIED)</span> - [[Software Knowledges/Programming Language/Java/Java Framework/Java Spring Security/2.4 Authorization#^AccessDecisionVoter-static-fields-named\|#^AccessDecisionVoter-static-fields-named]]
		- `verify` method call check, throw `AccessDeniedException` when check method return NEGATIVE `AuthorizationDecision`
	- <span style="color:#00b050">Delegate-based `AuthorizationManager` Implementations - how does ?</span>
		- <span style="color:#555555">To help `AuthorizationManager` to control access decision --> this interface has its own a composition(t·ªï h·ª£p) </span>of¬†`AuthorizationManager`¬†implementations in the following picture here:  
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ybFnvs4.png)
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/iUbDgaM.png)
		- SprSe ships with a delegating `AuthorizationManager` - collaborate with individual `AuthorizationManager`s
		- <span style="color:#d4a216">Match request</span> - `RequestMatcherDelegatingAuthorizationManager` - an implementation of `AuthorizationManager` interface --> match the request with the most appropriate delegate¬†`AuthorizationManager` (delegates to a specific¬†[`AuthorizationManager`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/authorization/AuthorizationManager.html "interface in org.springframework.security.authorization")¬†based on a¬†[`RequestMatcher`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/web/util/matcher/RequestMatcher.html "interface in org.springframework.security.web.util.matcher")¬†evaluation)
		- <span style="color:#d4a216">Method Security</span> - can use 
			- `AuthorizationManagerBeforeMethodInterceptor` - A `MethodInterceptor` which uses a `AuthorizationManager` to determine if an `Authentication` may invoke the given `MethodInvocation` (the method that is assigned for specific authority - ex: a function only allow role admin)
			- `AuthorizationManagerAfterMethodInterceptor`- A MethodInterceptor which can determine if an Authentication has access to the result of an MethodInvocation using an AuthorizationManager

	- <span style="color:#00b050"> Hierarchical Roles</span>
		- requirement that a particular role in an application should automatically "include" other roles.
		- The use of a role-hierarchy allows you to configure which roles (or authorities) should include others.
		- ¬†An extended version of Spring Security‚Äôs¬†`RoleVoter`,¬†`RoleHierarchyVoter`, is configured with a¬†`RoleHierarchy`, from which it obtains all the "reachable authorities" which the user is assigned.

       > - The decide` method is passed all the relevant information it needs - (information are "authentication obj", the "secured object", the configuration attributes associated with the "secured object" being invoked) ---> to <span style="color:#d4a216">make an authorization decision</span>
       > - `The supports(ConfigAttribute)` method is called by the `AbstractSecurityInterceptor` at startup time ---> <span style="color:#d4a216">determine if the `AccessDecsionManager` can process the passed `ConfigAttribute`</span>.
       >	- `The suports(Class)` method - called by a security interceptor implementation to <span style="color:#d4a216">ensure the configured `AccessDecisionManager` supports the type of secure object </span>that the security interceptor presents
