# 1. Feature Overview
As a framework, Spring Security provides support security in 3 aspects : Authentication - Authorization - Mechanism Protection Against Common Attacks 
## 1.1 Authentication
- What is authentication ? 
	Authentication - how we verify the identity of who is trying to access a particular resource.
   üçé Reference: [Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)
---
*<span style="color:#9a7db0">In authentication, the most thing need to concern is the password</span>*
- Password Storage
	- Descript: password Storage indicate how to store the raw password securely by using encrypt password techniques in one-way transformation with the support of SprSe via Password Encoder Interface
		- History of encrypt password to store password securely [See](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/features/authentication/password-storage.html#authentication-password-storage-history)
		- Delegating Password Encoder with the support of SprSe
			- A mechanism for calling which encrypt password type will be invoke by choosing one of multiple of encrypt password type (BCrypt PasswordEncoder example)
			- Create instance of `DelegatingPasswordEncoder`
			- Create and config to custom `DelegatingPasswordEncoder`
			   ![](https://i.imgur.com/jaYS5W4.png)
	- Password Storage Format
		- How the format password save differ from raw text -  the encoded password format to avoid human readable ?
		- Example to show base on the password format Id - we can know to call which Password Encoder when `DelegatePasswordEncoder` instance
	      ![](https://i.imgur.com/uv1ODwk.png)
	- Password Encoding
		- Refer to `id` ForEncode - a sign to determines which PasswordEncoder is used for encoding passwords
	- Password Matching
		- Matching to identify the Password Encoder for encode password
	      ![](https://i.imgur.com/uv1ODwk.png)
	    <span style="color:#92d050">* By default, the result of invoking¬†`matches(CharSequence, String)`¬†with a password and an¬†`id`¬†that is not mapped (including a null id) results in an¬†`IllegalArgumentException`. This behavior can be customized by using¬†</span>
         `DelegatingPasswordEncoder.setDefaultPasswordEncoderForMatches(PasswordEncoder)`	 
		- Quick demo show password is really encoded	 
	      ![](https://i.imgur.com/5dZUUq3.png)
	- Password Storage Configuration 
		- Because DelegatingPasswordEncoder will call initial config - default, the PasswordEncoder will encode pass word using Bcrypt Password Encoder  like this
	      ![](https://i.imgur.com/MAjFdsE.png)
	      <span style="color:#c1ff80">*==> You want to config / custom default PasswordEncoder --->  custom default by 2 way*</span>
	   - Way 1 - custom DelegatingPasswordEncoder
		   ![](https://i.imgur.com/Cl4cU9g.png)
		- Way 2 - customize by exposing a¬†**PasswordEncoder**¬†as a Spring bean
		   <span style="color:#555555">Example:</span>

> [!Tip] Summary 
><span style="color:#3adf97"> To implement password encoder in SprSe, do following : </span>
>  * 1st - Config which PasswordEncoder will in used for encoding password
>  * 2st - Config PasswordEncoder as Default DelegatingPasswordEncoder

## 1.2 Authorization

- What it is ? 
	* Indicate which doors you are allow to access 
	* Spring Security provides¬†[defense in depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing))¬†by allowing for request based authorization and method based authorization.

## 1.3 Protection Against Exploits
### CSRF
![](https://i.imgur.com/r0uwGSC.png)
-  <span style="color:#00b0f0">What it is ?</span>
	- An attack that the **evil will embedded the valid data** but **send the request to the server via the link embedded in the button and entices** the user to click the button to send the request which have already authenticated previously
			![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-128d7b63046fc10e74bf6346e7da0ed6)
			![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220330113139/csrf.jpg)
- <span style="color:#00b0f0">Protecting Against CSRF</span>
	* Safe Methods Must be Read-only
		- ensure that¬†["safe" HTTP methods are read-only](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.1) (? how )
		- Consider Implements the CSRF for specific perspective of web app
			- Logging In
			- Logging Out
			- CSRF and Session Timeouts
			- Multipart (file upload)
			- How to include CSRF Token
			- Place CSRF Token in the Body of the request
			- Include CSRF Token in URL
	* <span style="color:#00b0f0">Synchronizer Token Pattern</span>
		- When an HTTP request is submitted -> server must look up the expected CSRF token -> compare against the actual CSRF token in HTTP request
		- The token must be store under the way as a part of the HTTP request || in the header --> so that the CSRF will not be automatically included by the browser 
		- To achieve, we can <span style="color:#2dd267">get the CSRF token in an HTTP parameter OR an HTTP header</span> --> protect against CSRF attacks
			(by this way, if hacker requires the actual CSRF token in a cookie --> not work because cookies are automatically included in the HTTP request by the browser but CSRF is stored in away avoid sending automatically with the request )
			![](https://i.imgur.com/EH1kK8P.png)
	* SameSite Attribute
		- Specify SameSite Attribute on cookies
		- A server can specify the SameSite attribute when setting a cookie --> to indicate that **the cookie should not be sent if the request is coming from external sites.

### HTTP Header
 - <span style="color:#00b0f0">What it is ?</span>
	 - Manipulate using [HTTP response headers](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#div-headers) to increase the security of web applications. Once set, these HTTP response headers can restrict modern browsers from running into easily preventable vulnerabilities.
	 - The Spring Security support various HTTP response headers, base on its idea of security of using headers, you can take benefits SrpSe in supporting headers and you can config, custom headers
- > [!TIP]
 > <span style="color:#4ee4b7">Let explore how Spring Security Support HTTP response headers ?</span>
- Default Spring Security Headers - SprSe provides a secure default set of security related HTTP response headers, the defaults include the following headers:
```
	Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidatePragma: no-cache
	Expires: 0
	X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
	Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000 ; includeSubDomains
	X-Frame-Options: DENY
	X-XSS-Protection: 0
```
 <span style="color:#555555">*--> If defaults do not meet your needs -> let remove, modify, add headers from these defaults.*</span>
- <span style="color:#00b0f0">Let explore additional details on each of above headers</span>
	- <span style="color:#4ee4b7">Cache Control</span>
		- *The main purpose of header in helping security is what ?*
			- Dictates browser caching behavior
		- *The case context you should need this header ?*
			- When someone visits a website, the browser will save certain resources: images, website data in a store called the "CACHED" -> When user revisits, the website, cached-control sets the rule which determine whether that user will have those resources loaded from their local cache OR whether the browser have to send a request to the server for fresh resources.
	    - *Why it is a matter ?*
			- Base on the working of cached control --> we need rule the cached control because "If a user authenticates to view sensitive information and then logs out, we do not want a malicious user to be able to click the back button to view the sensitive information from the cached"
	- <span style="color:#4ee4b7">Content Type Options</span>
		- *The main purpose of header in helping security is what ?*
	 		- used by server to indicate to the browsers that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers -> browser should be followed and not guessed -> block browsers 'MIME type sniffing, which can transform non-executable MIME types into executable MIME types'
	 	- *The case context you should need this header ?*
	 		- Browser usually try to guess the content type of a request by using "Content Sniffing" to improve the user experience by guessing the content type on resources that had not specified the content type.	
	 	- *Why it is a matter ?*
	 		- Problem with content sniffing --> allowed malicious users to use polyglots (a file that is valid as multiple content types) to perform XSS attacks.	
	- <span style="color:#4ee4b7">HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</span>
		- *The main purpose of header in helping security is what ?*
			- add the url `mybank.example.com` (ex) with HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) --> a browser can know ahead of time that any request to `HTTP` `mybank.example.com` should be interpreted as `HTTPs` `https://mybank.example.com` --> REDUCEs the possibility of a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
		- *The case context you should need this header ?*
			- For example, between 2 url of bank's website :
			`HTTP` - `mybank.example.com` vs `HTTPs` `https://mybank.example.com`  
			-> if omit the https protocol --> potentially vulnerable to [Man-in-the-Middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)¬†- a¬†cyberattack¬†where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the¬†between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other, as the attacker has inserted themselves between the two parties
			![](https://i.imgur.com/xaw0plU.png)
		- *Why it is a matter ?*
			- Base on the case context above, when you ignore https link access -> a malicious user could intercept the initial HTTP request like  `mybank.example.com` and manipulate the response. This also happen even if you link to `HTTP` -`mybank.example.com` and redirect to `HTTPs` -`https://mybank.example.com`, bad user can steal your credentials 

      > [!NOTE] *How Spring support HTTP Strict Transport Security* 
       > 			- One way for a site to be marked as a HSTS host is to **have the host preloaded into the browser**. 
       > 			- *The preload -> directive instructs the browser that the domain should be preloaded int Browser as AN HSTS DOMAIN* --> Details on on HSTS preload -> see üëÅÔ∏è [hstspreload.org](https://hstspreload.org/) 
       > 			- Another way - **add the Strict-Transport-Security header** to the response. 
       > 			- SpringSe's default behaviour is to add the following header - instruct the browser to trete the domain as an HSTS host for a year 
       > 			`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000 ; includeSubDomains ; preload`	  
	- <span style="color:#4ee4b7">X-Frame-Options</span>
		- *The main purpose of header in helping security is what ?*
			- used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a¬†`<frame>`,¬†`<iframe>`,¬†`<embed>`¬†or¬†`<object>`. 
			--> Sites can use this to avoid¬†[clickjacking](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking)¬†attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.
		- *The case context you should need this header ?*
			- Using clever CSS styling, users could be tricked into clicking on something that they were not intending 
		- *Why it is a matter ?*
			- Base on the case context above, a user that logged into their bank might click a button that grants access to other users --> CALL A NAME "Clickjacking" ATTACK
	- <span style="color:#4ee4b7">X-XSS-Protection</span>
		- *The main purpose of header in helping security is what ?*
			- filter out reflected XSS attacks
			- a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
		> [!WARNING]
		>- There is a warning of using this header, it work well to protect users of older web browser that do not yet support CSP. In some cases, this header can create XSS vulnerabilities in otherwise safe website source
		- 
		> [!RECOMMEND]
		>- Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) that disables the use of inline JavaScript.    
	- <span style="color:#4ee4b7">Content Security Policy (CSP)</span>
		- *The main purpose of header in helping security is what ?*
			- a security feature that is used to specify the origin of content that is allowed to be loaded on a website or in a web applications. 
			- it is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks including CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING XSS and data injection attacks. These attacks are which used for everything from data theft to site defacement to distribution of malware
		   >[!NOTE] CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING - XSS attacks  
		   >- CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING - XSS attacks: attacker attaches code onto legitimate website -> the website the will execute when the victim loads the website. That malicious code can be inserted in several ways. Popularly, added to the end of a url or posted directly onto a page that displays user-generated content
		   >![](https://www.cloudflare.com/img/learning/security/threats/cross-site-scripting/xss-attack.png)		
		- *The case context you should need this header ?*
			(Take the XSS attack as an example) 	Different types of cross-site scripting (2 types popular):
			- Reflected cross-site scripting: malicious code is added onto the end of the url of a website -> victim loads this link in the web browser -> browser execute the code injected into the url, for example :
			  ![](https://i.imgur.com/8ypkv6y.png)
			- Persistent cross-site scripting: happens on sites that let users post content that other users will see, such as a comment forum or social media --> if the site does not properly validate the inputs for user-generated content --> attacker insert code that other users' browsers will execute when the page loads
			  ![](https://i.imgur.com/bqiWu7P.png)
		- >[!Info] How Spring support CSP
		>	- CSP is not intended to solve all content injection vulnerabilities -> use CSP help reduce the harm caused by content injection attacks. But the first line of defense, web app authors should validate their input and encode their output
		>	- A web app use CSP by including one of the following HTTP headers in the response:
		> 		`Content-Security-Policy`
		>		 `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`
		>		*Two type of header will work to allow to execute the external trusted script* 
		>		 `Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://trustedscripts.example.com`
		>		 `Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://trustedscripts.example.com; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint/`
		>		 `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: script-src 'self' https://trustedscripts.example.com; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint/`

### HTTP Request
- All HTTP-based communication (communicate by using HTTP protocol), including static resources -- should be protected by using TLS.
> [!Caution]
> - As a framework, SPRING SECURITY does not handle HTTP connections --> does not provide support for `HTTPS` directly. 
> - However, it does provide a number of features that help with HTTPS USAGE
- Redirect to HTTPs
	- When a client uses HTTP -> let configure SprSe to redirect to HTTPs 
	*Redirect in servlet*
	![](https://i.imgur.com/uLGKJQh.png)
- Strict Transport Security default and config
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/sQKYQxT.png)
- Proxy Server Configuration
	- *Why this come to the picture ?**
		- When using a proxy server --> important to ensure that you have configured your application properly
		- For example, many applications have a load balancer that responds to request for `https://example.com/` -> forwarding the request to an application server (another version of original server) `https://192.168.0.107` 
		- > [!FAIL]
        > ---> Without proper configuration. the application server cannot know that the load balancer exists (the other version of original server exists have the ip `192.168.0.107` example ) and treats the request as though `https://192.168.0.107:8080`¬†was requested by the client
	- To fix - to make application aware of this new version of server to forward request for working -> you need to <span style="color:#aaee2b">configure you application server to be aware of the `X-Forwarded` headers</span>. *For example,* 
		- Tomcat uses¬†`RemoteIpValve`
		- Jetty uses¬†`ForwardedRequestCustomizer`
		- Spring Boot user can use `server.forward-headers-strategy`¬†property to configure the application (see [Spring Boot documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto.webserver.use-behind-a-proxy-server))
		- Spring user can use¬†
			[`ForwardedHeaderFilter`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/filters.html#filters-forwarded-headers)¬†with the Servlet stack 
			[`ForwardedHeaderTransformer`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux/reactive-spring.html#webflux-forwarded-headers)¬†with the Reactive stack

  - > [!INFO] Proxy
    - a server that acts as a gateway or intermediary between any device and the rest of the internet. 
    - A proxy accepts and forwards connection requests, then returns data for those requests. 
    - It uses the anonymous network id instead of actual IP address of client (means it hides the IP address of client), so that the actual IP address of client couldn‚Äôt be reveal

    ![](https://images.viblo.asia/5bb9830d-184c-4aea-ba9e-a5e77f742444.png)
  - > [!INFO] Load Balancer
     - A practice of distributing computational workloads between two or more computer.
     - On the internet, load balancing is often employed to divide network traffic among several servers (one server but have many brothers and sisters server has the same configuration. Brothers ,sisters can be under the form of physical hardware or virtual on cloud)
     - This system design will help to reduces the strain on each server and make the servers more efficient, speeding up performance and reducing latency
