# 2.2 Architecture
  Discusses SprSe's high-level architecture within Servlet based applications
#### 2.2.1 - A review of Servlet Filters
- The filters is really powerful in helping SprSe building a secure Servlet Application
	- Java Servlet Filter

 <span style="color:#d7771d"> -> SprSe support Servlet security based on Servlet Filters</span>.

 <span style="color:#555555">Figure FilterChain - shows the typical layering of the handlers for a single HTTP request</span>
  ---
- Explain flow working
	 - Client sends a request to the application
	 - Container creates a `FilterChain` - which contains the <span style="color:#d7771d">`Filter` instances and Servlet</span> (indicated by the `DispatcherServlet` based on the path of the request `URI`) to process the coming `HttpServletRequest`
		- <span style="color:#555555">Servlet is an instance of [`DispatcherServlet`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.0/reference/html/web.html#mvc-servlet) </span>
		- <span style="color:#555555">Servlet is a class which responsible for accepting a request, processing it, and sending a response back -> handles a single `HttpServletRequest`¬†and¬†`HttpServletResponse`</span>
	- `Filter` comes to the picture with its <span style="color:#d7771d">power comes from the `FilterChain`</span> that where `filter` is passed into it, by using this power we can
		- **Prevent downstream** `Filter` instances or the Servlet from being invoked. (The Filter in this case typically  writes the `HttpServletResponse`)
		- **Modify** the `HttpServletRequest`¬†or¬†`HttpServletResponse`¬†used by the downstream¬†`Filter`¬†instances and the¬†`Servlet`.
	> [!Note] Note
	> Since a filter in advance impacts only downstream Filter (For ex : Filter 2 can be impact by Filter 1, Filter 3 can be impact Filter 2, Filter 1 can disrupt results in Filter 3, but directly to Filter 2)
	>> [!Attention]
	>> The order in which each Filter is invoked is extremely important
- Usage FilterChain example
	``` Java
		public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) {
		// do something before the rest of the application
	    chain.doFilter(request, response); // invoke the rest of the application
	    // do something after the rest of the application
	}
	```

#### 2.2.2 - DelegatingFilterProxy
- <span style="color:#00b0f0">**What it really is ?**</span>
	- Spring provides a `Filter` implementation named `DelegatingFilterproxy` --> <span style="color:#d4a216">Allows Bridging between the Servlet container's lifecycle and Spring's ApplicationContext</span>
	-  *<span style="color:#92d050">It is a servlet filter but allows passing control to specific Filter classes that have access to the Spring application context = registered as a `@Bean` - this filter class can be called as a Spring-managed bean that implements the Filter Interface </span>*
		*--> It is a Proxy for a standard Servlet Filter, delegating to a Spring-managed bean that implements the Filter interface.*

	--- 
- <span style="color:#00b0f0">**What it really work ?**</span>
	- The Servlet container allows registering `Filter` instances  by using its own standard. 
	- > [!NOTE] Note - Review Configuration `Filter`
	   > - To use `filter` for servlet --> need to Config Servlet Filter - a way to register Filter information in file web.xml (`Deployment Descriptor File`) --> so that the Servlet Container knows which filters need to create instance at the first time deployed and then uses to filter any specific coming request based on filter-mapping url configuration.
	   > - Let see how to create `Filter` class and register them in file xml

	   > ![](https://i.imgur.com/BWKKjRo.png)
	   > ![](https://i.imgur.com/wA1xvbc.png)
	- <span style="color:#d4a216">BUT BY THIS WAY, these instances is not aware of Spring-defined Beans</span> --> Instead, you can register <span style="color:#d4a216">`DelegatingFilterProxy` through the standard Servlet Container mechanisms but can delegate all the work to a Spring Bean that implements `Filter`</span> 
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ddBVANT.png)
	> - <span style="color:#00b0f0">Explain how does it work ?</span>
	> 	- `DelegatingFilterProxy` looks up Bean Filter(0) from the ApplicationContext - the context in the Spring Framework --> then invokes Bean Filter(0).
	> 	- `DelegatingFilterProxy`¬†Pseudo Code
	> 	 
	>	   ```Java
	>	      public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) {
	>      Filter delegate = getFilterBean(someBeanName); 1
	>		  delegate.doFilter(request, response); 2
	>		  }
	>		 ```
	>	 - 1 - Lazily get Filter that was registered as a Spring Bean (Lazily - mean load instance filter just when the first time call this Filter). For ex, DelegatingFilterProxy delegate is an instance of Bean Filter(0)
	>	 - 2 - Now, delegate work to the Spring Bean
	>	 > [!Note] Benefit of¬†`DelegatingFilterProxy`
	>	 > - Allows delaying looking up Filter bean instance
	>	 >	--> This is important, because the *container needs to register the `Filter` Instances before the container can start up* -->  HOWEVER, with SPRING typically uses a `ContextLoaderListener` to load the Spring Beans --> but it not done until after the `Filter` instances need to be registered

  > What you can see here from Proxy idea ? 
  > --> Proxy is going to create a new proxy class - this class implement the same interface as the primary class, but this proxy instead implements its own logic code for overriding the abstract method interface -> it going to invoke the logic code from the primary class which implement the same interface.
  > But the power of proxy in here is that ---> allow you to execute before or after the primary logic of the primary class

#### 2.2.3 - FilterChainProxy
- Spring Security's Servlet support is contained within `FilterChainProxy`. 
- `FilterChainProxy` - <span style="color:#d4a216"> special `Filter` provided by SprSe - allows delegating to many `Filter` instance through `SecurityFitlerChain`</span>
- Because `FilterChainProxy` is A Bean  --> it typically wrapped in a `DelegatingFilterProxy`
	![](https://i.imgur.com/hK4RaSt.png)
> [!SUMMARY]
> - Meaning SprSe practice the security for upcoming request in the filter layer - to call which filter instances are used to check security -> the `FilterChainProxy` use `SecurityFitlerChain` - this will delegate the appropriate Security Filters )
#### 2.2.4 - SecurityFilterChain
- `SecurityFilterChain` - used by FilterChainProxy, <span style="color:#d4a216">help to determine which **Spring Security `Filter` Instances** should be invoked for the current request.</span>
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/lpdom8X.png)
- The `Security Filters` in `SecurityFilterChain` are typically `Beans` - but registered with `FilterChainProxy` instead of `DelegatingFilterProxy`
- Using `FilterChainProxy` provides you a number of <span style="color:#92d050">advantages to registering</span> <span style="color:#92d050">directly with the `Servlet Container` Or `DelegatingFilterProxy`</span>
	- First - provies a starting point for all of Spring `Security's Servlet support` --> if you try to troubleshoot with `Security's Servlet support` --> let <span style="color:#92d050">adding a debug point in `FilterChainProxy`</span>
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/X3ROAFi.png)

		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/TnGCOIT.png)
		> üçé(Find the Registered Spring Security Filters)[https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-registered-filters] 

	- Second - `FilterChainProxy` - a central to SprSe usage 
		- --> it can <span style="color:#92d050">perform tasks that are not viewed as optional</span> (Ex: clears out the `SecurityContext` to avoid memory leaks)
		- --><span style="color:#92d050"> applies SprSe's `HttpFirewall` </span>to protect application against certain types of attacks
	- More - provides more flexibility in <span style="color:#92d050">DETERMINING WHEN A `SecurityFilterChain` SHOULD BE INVOKED</span>
	- > [!Note]
		- > In general **Filter Instances** are invoked based upon the URL alone - but with `FilterChainProxy` - it help to <span style="color:#92d050">determine invocation of which specific `SecurityFilterChain` based upon anything in the `HttpServletRequest`¬†by using the¬†`RequestMatcher`¬†interface</span>
		- > Let see how is based on `RequestMatcher` idea ?
			* ![](https://i.imgur.com/pXXqDJ5.png)
			- > Regard the `SecurityFilterChain` like a box which contains only need filters for specific request url --> by this way, there are multi `SecurityFilterChain` for different urls
			- > <span style="color:#d4a216">Each `SecurityFilterChain` can have **different number of Filter instances**</span> (for ex, `SecurityFilterChain`(0) has 3 but `SecurityFilterChain`(n) has 4), can have <span style="color:#d4a216">**Zero security Filter**</span> for the case ignore security to a certain requests and can be <span style="color:#d4a216">**configured in isolation**</span>.
			>  
			- > Let explain how `SecurityFilterChain` is useful ?
			> - In the Multiple `SecurityFilterChain` figure above, `FilterChainProxy` decides which `SecurityFilterChain` - which big box filter should be used. By this way, 
			> - if url start with /api/*, /api/messages/ -> then only the first `SecurityFilterChain`(0)¬†that matches is invoked.
			> - if url is /messages/ is requested - do not match on the `SecurityFilterChain`(0) pattern /api/** -> `FilterChainProxy` continues trying to each `SecurityFilterChain` --> assuming that no other `SecurityFilterChain` instances match --> then `SecurityFilterChainn`(n)¬†is invoked.

	- > [!Note] 
	  > In Spring Security, The `FilterChainProxy` has already the `DefaultSecurityFilterChain` for all the request upcoming,
	  > --> if you want custom config `SecurityFitlerChain` for specific urls let go to create you own `SecurityFilterChain` like this and config based on java config :

#### 2.2.5 - Security Filters
- `Security Filters` are inserted into the `FilterChainProxy` with the `SecurityFilterChain API`
- Those filters can be used for purposes like authentication, authorization, exploit protection and more
- <span style="color:#d4a216">The Filers are executed in a specific order</span> to guarantee that they are invoked at the right time
	- For exam, Filter performs authentication should be invoked before the Filter that performs authorization
- üçé Want to know the ordering of Spring Security's Filter --> see ¬†[`FilterOrderRegistration`¬†code](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/6.2.0/config/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/config/annotation/web/builders/FilterOrderRegistration.java)
- <span style="color:#3adf97">Printing The Security Filters</span> - a kind of logging filters to the console
	- Useful to see the list of security `Filters` that are invoked for a particular request
	- üçé Let see how to config to log the filters information : [## Logging](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/architecture.html#servlet-logging)
- <span style="color:#3adf97">Adding a Custom Filter</span> to the Filter Chain
	- Their might be times you want to add a custom `Filter` to the existing security filter chain --> üçé let see example of add new filter : [Adding a Custom Filter to the Filter Chain](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/architecture.html#adding-custom-filter)

#### 2.2.6 - Handling Security Exceptions
- The `ExceptionTranslationFilter` allows translation of `AccessDeniedException` and `AuthenticationException` into HTTP responses.
- `ExceptionTranslationFilter` is inserted into the `FilterChainProxy` as one of the Security Filters.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Skd8I7S.png)
- üçé Let see in big picture: [Handling Security Exceptions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/architecture.html#servlet-exceptiontranslationfilter)

#### 2.2.7 - Saving Requests Between Authentication
- Why you need ? Look back to the picture of `Handling Security Exceptions`, <span style="color:#d4a216">when a request has no authentication and is for a resource that requires authentication --> a need to save the request for the authenticated resource to later re-request after authentication is Successfully</span>.
- In Spring, the place to store the request-`HttpServletRequest` is to use a [`RequestCache`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/architecture.html#requestcache)¬†implementation
- The filter which uses the¬†[`RequestCache`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/architecture.html#requestcache)¬†to save the¬†`HttpServletRequest` is¬†[`RequestCacheAwareFilter`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/6.2.0/api/org/springframework/security/web/savedrequest/RequestCacheAwareFilter.html)¬† 
- But the default request cache get implemented is `HttpSessionRequestCache`. --> Let see the code to show how to customize the¬†`RequestCache`¬†implementation that is used to check the¬†`HttpSession`¬†for a saved request if the parameter named¬†`continue`¬†is present 
	```Java
	@Bean
	DefaultSecurityFilterChain springSecurity(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	HttpSessionRequestCache requestCache = new HttpSessionRequestCache();
	requestCache.setMatchingRequestParameterName("continue");
	http
		// ...
		.requestCache((cache) -> cache
			.requestCache(requestCache)
		);
	return http.build();
	}
	```

#### 2.2.8 Logging
- Printing the Security Filters to track for DEBUG and TRACE
- Let see the interesting example :
	- Example where a user tries to make a¬†`POST`¬†request to a resource that has¬†[CSRF protection](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/exploits/csrf.html)¬†enabled without the CSRF token. With no logs, the user will see a 403 error with no explanation of why the request was rejected. However, if you enable logging for Spring Security, you will see a log message like this:

		```text
